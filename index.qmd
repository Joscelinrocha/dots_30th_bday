Hey golfers! Here’s everything you need to know for the game:

**Starting Hole (Beantown Pub):** If you want to kick off the game from Hole 1, meet us at [Beantown Pub](https://beantownpub.com/) **between 3:00 and 3:30 PM.** At Beantown, you’ll receive your scorecard, course map, and all the details you need to get started.

**Following the Course at Your Own Pace:** You’re welcome to go off on your own and follow the course at your own pace! Just keep an eye on the time—[the round officially wraps up between 7:30 and 8:00 PM at The Dubliner.]{.underline} Feel free to use Uber if you need to get to the next hole! [\[Click here for the bar lineup\]](https://dotsbday.com/holes)

**No Dress Code:** There’s no dress code for the course, so wear whatever you’re comfortable in for the day!

**Joining Later?** If you’re joining at a later hole, text me to find out where we are, and we’ll keep you posted.

**Playing Options:** Each “hole” (bar) has options for wet, dry, or mixed play, so you’re welcome to participate without drinking at every bar (or any bar at all). This way, everyone can enjoy the game at their own pace.

**Eligibility to Win:** To be eligible to win, each golfer must play all holes, from Hole 1 to Hole 9, and play honestly. We’ll collect \$10 from each golfer at Hole 1, which goes towards the purse. Winner takes all – In the case of a tie the purse will be divided evenly!
