1.  Golfers should aim to complete each hole at par or better by following the challenges at each hole.

2.  This is a Par 3 course.

3.  Each hole has 2 different ways to score. You can choose whichever challenge you'd like to play every hole. You can play wet or dry or a mix.

4.  If your challenge requires an answer, write the answer on your scorecard. Otherwise, mark it with a checkmark.

5.  Penalties apply.

6.  Record your score for each hole based on your challenge completed.

7.  A win in the Guinness game is an automatic hole-in-one at any bar.

8.  Each bonus point will be a 1/2 point reduction on your total score after the final hole.

9.  You must complete each par to attempt a birdie and each birdie to attempt a Hole-in-one. You may choose not to complete any after you score and settle for par or birdie.
