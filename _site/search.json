At Beantown, you’ll receive your scorecard, course map, and all the details you need to get started.\nFollowing the Course at Your Own Pace: You’re welcome to go off on your own and follow the course at your own pace! Just keep an eye on the time—the round officially wraps up between 7:30 and 8:00 PM at The Dubliner. Feel free to use Uber if you need to get to the next hole! [Click here for the bar lineup]\nNo Dress Code: There’s no dress code for the course, so wear whatever you’re comfortable in for the day!\nJoining Later? If you’re joining at a later hole, text me to find out where we are, and we’ll keep you posted.\nPlaying Options: Each “hole” (bar) has options for wet, dry, or mixed play, so you’re welcome to participate without drinking at every bar (or any bar at all).
